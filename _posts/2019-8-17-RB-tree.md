## 2-3 tree & 2-4 tree

2-node: 1 key and 2 children
3-node: 2 keys and 3 children
4-node: 3 keys and 4 children

A (2,4) tree (also called 2-4 tree or 2-3-4 tree) is a multi-way search with the following properties:
* Node-Size Property: every internal node has at most four children
* Depth Property: all the external nodes have the same depth

### insertion

### deletion

## 2-4 tree ==> RB tree 

If break down 3-node and 4-node, 2-4 tree will become RB tree.

* 2-node ==> black node
* 3-node ==> left/right side red node and black node
* 4-node ==> two red node and a black node

RB tree represent a 2-4 tree in binary by providing a special balance strategy.

## RB tree rotate
```
* New node --> X
* Parent --> P
* Grandparent --> G
* Parent sibling --> S
```

1. **X** must be *red*
2. ***while loop***: **P** is *red*
    1. **P** is on the left of **G**
        1. **S** is *red*
            * Change **P** and **S** to *black*
            * Change **G** to *red*
            * Let **G** become **X** and back to ***while loop***
        2. **S** is *Black* or Null
            * ***IF***: **X** on the right of **P**. ***Then***: ***Rotate_left()***
            * Change **P** to *black*
            * Change **G** to *red*
            * ***Rotate_right()***
    2. **P** is on the right of **G**
        1. **S** is *red*
            * Change **P** and **S** to *black*
            * Change **G** to *red*
            * Let **G** become **X** and back to while loop
        2. **S** is *Black* or Null
            * ***IF***: **X** on the left of **P**. ***Then***: ***Rotate_right()***
            * Change **P** to *black*
            * Change **G** to *red*
            * ***Rotate_left()***
3. **ROOT** = *black* // In case change root.
