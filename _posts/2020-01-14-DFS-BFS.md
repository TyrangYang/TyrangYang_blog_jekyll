DFS & BFS are two basic algorithms to traverse a graph(or a tree). DFS is Deep-first search and BFS is Breath-first search.

## Basic idea

The idea behind two algorithms are identical but use different auxiliary data structure. DFS use _stack_ and BFS use _Queue_.

First, Every node have a mark to identify is already be visited or not(it could be a list or an attribute in node).

Second, Push the start point into the auxiliary data structure and loop until structure is empty.

Third, In the loop, pop a node from structure and mark as visited. Push all adjacent and unvisited node into it.

## Pseudocode

### DFS

```cpp
DFS(V){
    visited = [f,f,f...f];
    stack <- empty;
    stack.push(v);
    while(stack not empty){
        stack.pop();
        print(temp);
        for each v2 is adjacent to temp{
            if (v2 is not visited){
                stack.push(v2);
                mark v2 as visited;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### BFS

```cpp
BFS(V){
    visited = [f,f,f...f];
    queue <- empty;
    queue.push(v);
    while(queue not empty){
        queue.pop();
        print(temp);
        for each v2 is adjacent to temp{
            if (v2 is not visited){
                queue.push(v2);
                mark v2 as visited;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
